# jsonparser
the JSON soon-to-be-parser I wrote for the article on my page.

this can probably be optimized, but for being my first Rust project, it's really damn cool

## building
like literally every other Rust project; clone the repository and call `cargo build`.
though you're better using `cargo run <json file>` to directly run it.
